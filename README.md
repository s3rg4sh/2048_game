This project is a copy of the well-known game 2048, which can be played right on the page. The game has a scoring system, and you can restart the game if you fail to win. There is also a smooth animation that improves the user experience. The game was developed using JavaScript as well as HTML and CSS with SASS preprocessor to create and design the page.
